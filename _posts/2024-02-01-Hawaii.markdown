description: Experience the sunshine and warmth of the Pacific Islands. Tied up my favorite rope bunny on the Puna Coastline, delighting in the ocean waves and crisp breezes. Traded sunscreen for a pool cue, to shoot our way through Honolulu's nightlife. Jungle and beaches, the ultimate escape from the usual.
