description: Why limit yourself to the resturant and hotel experience? Let me be a guide that can take you deeper than REI. I've backpacked the Artic Natinal Wildlife Refuge in AK, Applachian Trail in MA/NH/MA, Long Trail in VT, Joshua Tree National Park, and  many other East Coast destinations. During the day, we'll explore the wonders of nature, stretching our legs under the big sky. A trail dinner, and then cuddle in close to keep each other warm on those chilly nights, as the sun drops away behind the mountains and the stars sparkle overhead as if shining just for us. References required for remote location overnights.
