description: Turned my face to the sun during the warm days to warm the soul, and then cuddled down into sleeping bags for the icy nights in this harsh desert environment. Half the park is at night, take a chilly stroll to experience more stars than any orgasm beneath the Dark Sky Reserve in Josha Tree National Park.
