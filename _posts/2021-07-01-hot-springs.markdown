description: Started the retreat with a quick dip into the hot springs, that became our morning and evening ritual. Delighted on fresh caught salmon, and tales from the fisherman who caught it. Took a trail ride with an Alaskian dog-sled team, including free kisses from the canines. Reset my muscles with a massage after a horseback ride through the forrest to experience the raw wilderness. A cell-phone free escape from the modern world.
