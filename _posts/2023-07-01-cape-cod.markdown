description: Dipped toes in the sandy waters of Cape Cod, and hiked along the beach under the summer sun. Crossed the dunes into a protected forrest, to sleep under the stars but within earshot of the rolling ocean waves. Hiked back through the tributaries, and inland marshes before returning to civilization for an ice cream reward.
